Cook with less fat.

Replace whole milk in recipes with low fat or skim milk.

Replace cream in recipes with evaporated skim milk.

Use smaller amounts of full-fat cheese, such as cheddar, or use lower-fat cheese, such as part skim mozzarella.

Decrease the amount of fat in recipes. Do not decrease fat if the recipe has already been reduced in fat. Start by decreasing the fat by ¼. For example, if a cake recipe calls for 1 cup of margarine, use ¾ cup of margarine. The fat in recipes for quick bread, muffins and some soft cookies can be decreased by ½. For example, if a muffin recipe calls for 1 cup oil, use ½ cup oil.

Replace chocolate and nuts with raisins or chopped fresh fruits or canned fruits.

Replace sour cream with nonfat or low-fat source cream or low-fat yogurt.

Decrease the amount of oil in homemade salad dressings. Try using one part oil to two parts vinegar.
